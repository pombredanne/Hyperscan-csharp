[hyperscan](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan) is a high-performance multiple regex matching library.

It uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous matching of large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular expressions and for the matching of regular expressions across streams of data.

This project is a third-party developed using C++/CLI for the [hyperscan](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan) project to enable developers to integrate hyperscan in their .NET Core based projects.

## Supported platforms
Hyperscan - C# supports only Windows 8/8.1/10/Server 2016/2019 x64 with .NET Core >= 3.1, while support for 32-bit platform-only is **not** provided.

Using Hyperscan - C# is only available through .NET Core 3.1 applications, hence referencing `<TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>` within your *csproj*. The chosen platform must also be *x64* exclusively, x86 or AnyCPU targets are not supported due to native bindings from hyperscan being x64.

Those requirements are driven by the following statements:
* [hyperscan](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan) supports Windows 8+ as explained [here](http://intel.github.io/hyperscan/dev-reference/getting_started.html#software).
* C++/CLI does support .NET Core only targeting >= 3.1 and only on Windows, as stated [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/the-future-of-cpp-cli-and-dotnet-core-3/).
* 32-bit platform-only usage is marginal, especially on memory-intensive environment such as servers.
